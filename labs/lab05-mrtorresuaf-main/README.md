# Lab

* In months.cpp
  - create an `enum class Month` that represents the months of the year

* In demo.cpp
  - create an instance of `std::map`
  - use the `[]` operator add elements to the map
  - use a for-each loop to iterate over each key-value pai
  - if your compiler supports the c++20 standard, use the `contains` method to determine if a key is in the map
